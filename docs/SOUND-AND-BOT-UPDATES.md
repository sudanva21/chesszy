# 🎵 Sound Effects & Bot Personalities - Complete!

## ✅ What I Just Added

### 1. 🔊 **Complete Sound System**

Created professional sound effects using Web Audio API:

**Movement Sounds:**
- ✅ **Move piece** - Subtle click sound
- ✅ **Capture piece** - Descending tones (different from regular move)
- ✅ **Bot thinking** - Soft oscillating tone

**Game State Sounds:**
- ✅ **Check** - Rising urgent alarm (3 tones)
- ✅ **Checkmate** - Dramatic descending chord
- ✅ **Draw/Stalemate** - Neutral repeating tone

**Game Over Sounds:**
- ✅ **Victory** - Happy ascending melody + major chord
- ✅ **Defeat** - Sad descending melody
- ✅ **Draw** - Neutral ending tone

**Easy Difficulty:**

- **Description:** Just learning the basics, makes occasional mistakes
- **Greeting:** "Hey! Ready for your first game?"

**Medium Difficulty:**

**Hard Difficulty:**
