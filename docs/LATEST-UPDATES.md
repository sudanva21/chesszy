## 🎯 How Everything Works Now

### **Playing vs Bot:**
1. Make your move (you're white)
2. Bot thinks and responds (0.5s delay)
3. If bot gives check → **Your king turns red!** 🔴
4. Pieces get captured → **See them in sidebar**
5. Game ends → **Modal appears with retry options**
6. If you lost → **"Try Different Difficulty"** button appears
7. Click retry → **New game, same difficulty**

### **Playing Multiplayer:**
1. Both players make moves
2. King turns red when in check
3. Captured pieces tracked for both
4. Game ends → Winner gets +20, loser gets -10
5. Modal shows result
6. Retry → Go home to create new game

### **Visual Feedback:**
- ✅ **Red king** = You're in check!
- ✅ **Green highlight** = Your turn
- ✅ **Yellow squares** = Valid moves
- ✅ **Captured pieces** = Material advantage
- ✅ **Bot thinking** = Shows in UI
