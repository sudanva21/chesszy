ALTER TABLE match_history DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## If Still Getting Errors:

### Check Console for Specific Error

Look for errors that say:
- `relation "profiles" does not exist` ‚Üí Run schema SQL

- `401 Unauthorized` ‚Üí Check .env.local
- `500 Internal Server Error` ‚Üí Check you're signed in

## Nuclear Reset (If Nothing Works):

### 1. Delete Node Modules & Reinstall
```bash
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Reset Supabase (CAREFUL!)
```sql
-- This deletes ALL data
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS match_history CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS games CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS profiles CASCADE;

-- Then run schema-complete.sql again
```

### 3. Check Environment Variables
```env
# .env.local must have:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://qrgumafinbwogafytnys.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

---

## Quick Diagnostic:

**Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Should return:
-- profiles
-- games
-- match_history
```

**If tables don't exist:**
1. Open `supabase/schema-complete.sql`
2. Copy ALL contents
3. Paste in SQL Editor
4. Run it

---

## Expected Behavior After Fixes:

‚úÖ No favicon errors
‚úÖ Profile page loads (when signed in)
‚úÖ Can create account
‚úÖ Can play games
‚úÖ Leaderboard works

---

## Current Status Check:

Before proceeding, answer these:
- [ ] Did you run the schema SQL in Supabase?
- [ ] Do the tables (profiles, games, match_history) exist?
- [ ] Is your .env.local correct?
- [ ] Are you signed in when trying to access profile?

**If any answer is NO, fix that first!**

---

## The Real Issue:

The **500 error on /profile** means:
1. Server-side error in profile page
2. Usually because database query fails
3. Because tables don't exist OR
4. RLS blocks the query OR
5. User is not signed in

**Most likely: You haven't run the schema SQL yet!**

Go to Supabase ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí Run the complete schema from `schema-complete.sql`

Then restart your dev server and try again.
