## 🎮 How It Works

### **Board Orientation (2D & 3D)**

**When You Select White:**
```
3D View: Camera looks from White's perspective
2D View: White pieces at bottom

Both boards show:
  Black pieces (opponent) at top
  White pieces (you) at bottom
```

**When You Select Black:**
```
3D View: Camera looks from Black's perspective (flipped 180°)
2D View: Black pieces at bottom

Both boards show:
  White pieces (opponent) at top
  Black pieces (you) at bottom
```

**Result:** Your pieces are ALWAYS at the bottom in both 2D and 3D! ✅

### **Game Save/Resume**

**Automatic Saving:**
- Every move you make is automatically saved
- Saves to browser's localStorage
- Works only for bot games (not multiplayer)

**When You Return:**
1. Start a bot game with same difficulty & color
2. Modal appears asking: "Continue or New Game?"
3. Click "Continue" → Resume where you left off
4. Click "New Game" → Start fresh

## 🎮 How Camera Flip Works

### **3D Board Camera:**

**Default (White):**
```javascript
position: [0, 8, 8]
// Camera 8 units up, 8 units toward you
// Looks at board from white's side
```

**Flipped (Black):**
```javascript
position: [0, 8, -8]
// Camera 8 units up, 8 units away
// Looks at board from black's side (180° rotation)
```

### **Board Coordinates:**

**Default (White):**
```javascript
x = file - 3.5  // a=−3.5, h=3.5
z = rank - 3.5  // 1=−3.5, 8=3.5
```

**Flipped (Black):**
```javascript
x = 3.5 - file  // a=3.5, h=−3.5 (reversed)
z = 3.5 - rank  // 1=3.5, 8=−3.5 (reversed)
```
