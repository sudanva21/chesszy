## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Undo Implementation:**

**Store Updates:**
- Added `moveHistory` array to store FEN positions
- Added `undoMove()` function
- Tracks all moves for rollback

**How it works:**
```typescript
1. Before each move, save current FEN position
2. When undo clicked:
   - Pop last position from history
   - Load that position to board
   - Bot automatically makes its move
3. Undo again to remove bot's move too
```

**Why undo twice?**
- First undo: Removes bot's last move
- Second undo: Removes your last move
- Result: Back to your turn before that move!

---

### **Opponent Username Feature:**

**How it fetches:**
```typescript
1. When opponent joins, get their ID from game state
2. Query profiles table for their username
3. Update UI with fetched username
4. Cache result to avoid re-fetching
```

**Real-time sync:**
```typescript
1. Subscribe to game state changes
2. When player_id field updates:
   - Detect opponent has joined
   - Fetch their profile
   - Display username
3. Works bi-directionally (host ↔ joiner)
```
