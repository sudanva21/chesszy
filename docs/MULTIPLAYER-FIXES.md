# 🔧 Multiplayer Game Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Previous Bot Game Loading in Multiplayer** ❌→✅
**Problem:** When creating a multiplayer game after playing vs bot, the board showed the bot game's final position instead of starting fresh.

**Fix:** Added `resetGame()` call at the start of both bot and multiplayer games to reset the board to initial position.

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
if (isBotGame) {
  resetGame() // ← Added this
  setPlayerColor('white')
  ...
} else {
  resetGame() // ← Added this
  if (isHost) {
    createMultiplayerGame()
  }
}
```

### 2. **Game Code Not Showing** ❌→✅
**Problem:** Game code wasn't properly displayed for opponents to join.

**Status:** Game code display was already working, but board state issue made it look broken. Now fixed!

**Where to find it:**
- Game Info section (sidebar)
- "Invite Friend" section (when waiting for opponent)
- Copy button to share code

---

### 3. **Points Not Updating** ❌→✅
**Problem:** After winning/losing a multiplayer game, points weren't being added or subtracted from profile.

**Fix:** Added calls to `update_player_stats()` SQL function to update both players' points after game ends.

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Update winner's stats
await supabase.rpc('update_player_stats', {
  p_player_id: user.id,
  p_result: result,      // 'win', 'loss', or 'draw'
  p_points_change: pointsChange  // +20, -10, or 0
})

// Update opponent's stats
await supabase.rpc('update_player_stats', {
  p_player_id: opponentId,
  p_result: opponentResult,
  p_points_change: opponentPoints
})
```

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

**If board still shows old state:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors

**If points don't update:**
- Make sure you ran `FRESH-START-COMPLETE.sql`
- Check `update_player_stats` function exists in Supabase
- View SQL → Functions → Should see `update_player_stats`

**If game code doesn't show:**
- Make sure you're the host (created the game)
- Check "Game Info" section in sidebar
- Should see code in big monospace font
