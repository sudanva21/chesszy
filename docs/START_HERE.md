## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Set Up Supabase Backend

Your app is currently running with placeholder database credentials. To enable multiplayer:

1. Go to **[supabase.com](https://supabase.com)** → Create account
2. Create a new project (takes ~2 minutes)
3. Go to **SQL Editor** → Run the code from `supabase/schema.sql`
4. Go to **Settings** → **API** → Copy your:
   - Project URL
   - Anon public key

### 2️⃣ Add Your Credentials

Edit the `.env.local` file in your project:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...your-actual-key
```

Restart the dev server:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop, then:
npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ Test It Out!

Open **two browser windows**:
- Window 1: Click "Create New Game"
- Window 2: Click "Join Game" → Enter the code
- Play chess! ♟️
