# 🎨 Color Selection & Random Assignment - Complete!

## ✅ What I Added

### **1. Choose Your Color vs AI** ✅
Players can now select whether they want to play as White or Black when playing against the bot!

### **2. Random Color Assignment for Multiplayer** ✅
In multiplayer games, colors are now randomly assigned instead of always host=white, guest=black!

## 🎮 New Features

### **Bot Games - Color Selection**

**Homepage UI:**
```
┌──────────────────────┐
│   Play vs AI         │
├──────────────────────┤
│   Difficulty:        │
│  [Easy|Med|Hard]     │
├──────────────────────┤
│   Your Color:        │
│  [⚪ White|⚫ Black]  │ ← NEW!
├──────────────────────┤
│  [Start Bot Game]    │
└──────────────────────┘
```

**How It Works:**
1. Select difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
2. **NEW:** Choose your color (White or Black)
3. Click "Start Bot Game"
4. Play with your selected color!

### **Multiplayer - Random Colors**

**Before:**
- Host always plays as White ❌
- Guest always plays as Black ❌
- Predictable and boring

**After:**
- Host gets random color (50/50 chance) ✅
- Guest gets the opposite color ✅
- Fair and exciting!

**Example:**
```
Game 1: Host=White, Guest=Black
Game 2: Host=Black, Guest=White
Game 3: Host=White, Guest=Black
... Random every time!
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. Homepage (app/page.tsx)**
- Added `botColor` state for color selection
- Added color selector UI (White/Black buttons)
- Passes color to game URL: `?color=white` or `?color=black`

### **2. Game Page (app/game/[code]/page.tsx)**
- Reads `color` parameter from URL
- Sets player color based on selection
- Bot plays opposite color
- Random color assignment for host in multiplayer
- Guest automatically gets opposite color

### **3. Bot Logic**
- Detects player's selected color
- Bot plays opposite color
- Works for both White and Black

### **4. Multiplayer Logic**
- Host: Random color (Math.random())
- Guest: Joins as opposite color
- Database stores both player IDs correctly
